# Customer-Transaction-Prediction-Project

_This team project was required for Predictive Analytics course offered by the Master of Science in Business Analytics program at the Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota_

The data comes from a 2019 Kaggle competition(https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-transaction-prediction/overview). Santander Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Spanish Santander Group. As a retail bank, Santander Bank is continually working with the global data science community to explore new ways to solve one of the most challenging tasks: binary classification problems such as if a customer is satisfied, if a customer can pay the loan, or if a customer will make a transaction. 

The goal of this project is to discover the best approach to predict which customers will make a transaction in the future. This goal brings up two key challenges: first, transforming the raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem to the predictive models; second, designing a predictive model that has the best performance.

Overall we found feature engineering techniques can improve the prediction performance. And among all the models we tested, LightGBM algorithm has the best performance with AUC equals .923.
